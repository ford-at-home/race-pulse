# Python Implementation Ideas for Race Pulse

## ðŸ”§ Libraries
- **pandas**: for time-series data manipulation
- **scikit-learn**: for building statistical/ML models
- **xgboost / lightgbm**: if switching to advanced gradient boosting models
- **matplotlib / seaborn**: for visualizing trends, rank progressions, and deltas

## ðŸŒ± Open Source Projects
- [tslearn](https://github.com/tslearn-team/tslearn): time-series ML tools
- [sktime](https://github.com/sktime/sktime): forecasting/classification
- [pyts](https://github.com/johannfaouzi/pyts): time series classification

## ðŸ’¸ Inexpensive SaaS
- **Weights & Biases** or **Comet ML** for experiment tracking
- **Replicate.com** to run models as APIs
- **Streamlit Cloud** for quick public dashboards
