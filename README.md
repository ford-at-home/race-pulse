# Race Pulse

Race Pulse is a Python tool for analyzing time-series position data (like horse races) to predict likely winners mid-race. It uses statistical models to spot momentum shifts and winning patterns.

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python analyze_race.py --input data/example_race.csv
```

See `SPECS.md` for system design and `DEPLOY.md` for AWS deployment.
